1) Create "security_table". It should have email address and field on which we will be applying filter.

From Modeling tab, select Add Table:

security_table = 
DATATABLE(
    "Email Address", STRING,
    "Tenant", STRING,
    {
        {"user1@example.com", "TenantA"},
        {"user2@example.com", "TenantB"},
        {"user3@example.com", "TenantA"}
    }
)

2) Connect the tables on which we will be applying filter. Direction will be from security tabel to dimention table. 
3) From Modeling tab> Manage Role, select to create new role to apply filter on security table. 

[Email Address] == USERPRINCIPALNAME()
