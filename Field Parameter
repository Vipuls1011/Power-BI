1) Go to Modeling tab and select Parameter, Field. 

2) In add and reorder field, enter the columns for which we need breakdown, and create. It will create a new table.

If we need to add any value afterwards, we can modify it from formula bar.

3) Create a new slicer and add column from newly created table.

4) For the visual on which we need breakdown, add the same column.

5) We can also create field parameter for measures. Instead of columns, add already created measure.
